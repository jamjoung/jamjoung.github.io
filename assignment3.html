            <h2>What is Tofu?</h2>
            <p>Tofu, also known as bean curd, is a food prepared by coagulating soy milk and then pressing the resulting curds into solid white blocks of varying softness; it can be silken, soft, firm, extra firm or super firm. Beyond these broad textural categories, there are many varieties of tofu. It has a subtle flavor, so it can be used in savory and sweet dishes. It is often seasoned or marinated to suit the dish and its flavors, and due to its spongy texture it absorbs flavours well.</p>
            <p>Nutritionally, tofu is low in calories, while containing a relatively large amount of protein. It is high in iron, and can have a high calcium or magnesium content depending on the coagulants (e.g. calcium chloride, calcium sulphate, magnesium sulphate) used in manufacturing. Tofu first originated in China and has been consumed within China for over 2,000 years dating back to the Han dynasty. It is also a traditional component of the cuisines of East and Southeast Asia, including in Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>

            <h2>History of Tofu</h2>
            <p>Tofu-making was first recorded during the Chinese Han dynasty about 2000 years ago. Chinese legend ascribes its invention to Prince Liu An (179–122 BC) of Anhui province. Tofu and its production technique were introduced to Japan during the Nara period (710–794). Some scholars believe tofu arrived in Vietnam during the 10th and 11th centuries. It spread to other parts of Southeast Asia as well. This probably coincided with the spread of Buddhism as it is an important source of protein in the vegetarian diet of East Asian Buddhism. Li Shizhen, during the Ming Dynasty, described a method of making tofu in the Compendium of Materia Medica. Since then, tofu has become a staple in many countries, including Vietnam, Thailand, and Korea, with regional variations in production methods, texture, flavor, and usage.</p>

            <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Tofu</h2>

            <h4>Protein</h4>
            <p>Tofu is relatively high in protein, about 10.7% for firm tofu and 5.3% for soft "silken" tofu, with about 5% and 2% fat respectively, as mass fraction.Most of tofu mass is water, typically between 76% and 91%. In 1995, a report from the University of Kentucky, financed by Solae, concluded that soy protein consumption is correlated with significant decreases in serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, LDL ("bad cholesterol") and triglyceride concentrations.[85] However, high-density lipoprotein (HDL, "good cholesterol") did not increase. Soy phytoestrogens (isoflavones: genistein and daidzein) absorbed onto the soy protein were suggested as the agent reducing serum cholesterol levels. On the basis of this research, PTI in 1998 filed a petition with the Food and Drug Administration for a health claim that soy protein may reduce cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. The FDA granted this health claim for soy: "25 grams of soy protein a day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease". For reference, 100 grams of firm tofu coagulated with calcium sulfate contains 8.19 grams of soy protein. In January 2006 an American Heart Association review (in the journal Circulation) of a decade-long study of soy-protein benefits showed only a minimal decrease in cholesterol levels, but it compared favorably against animal protein sources.</p>
            
            <h4>Allergies</h4>
            <p>Because it is made of soy, individuals with allergies to legumes should not consume tofu.</p>
            
            <h4>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)</h4>
            <p>Tofu is considered a cooling agent in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It is believed to invigorate the spleen, replenish the qi, moisten and cool off the yang vacuity, as well as to "detoxify" the body.</p>
